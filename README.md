# csv_etl_to_datamart
This is for a screening test. This project aims to create a sales data mart for Brazilian e-commerce sales data using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The pipeline consists of three layers - raw/staging, clean/presentation, and mart.

The data used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle dataset - "Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist". The dataset consists of several CSV files containing information on orders, customers, products, reviews, and sellers.
